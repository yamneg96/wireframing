# Wireframing

## 0. Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital interface. It is a critical step in the design process, enabling designers and stakeholders to focus on functionality, structure, and layout without the distraction of colors or detailed graphics.

Wireframes help to:
- Clarify the structure of a website or app before development begins.
- Provide a reference point for developers and designers.
- Reduce the risk of design errors and enhance communication across teams.
